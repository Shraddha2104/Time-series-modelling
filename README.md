# Time-series-modelling

There are various methods to perform time series forecasting. Traditionally people have used AR, MA or ARIMA based models to perform forecasting. Prophet is an open source forecasting tool built by Facebook. It can be used for time series modeling and forecasting trends in the future. The advantage of using Prophet over traditional libraries is that one does not need to know the technicalities of time series, domain knowledge is not really required to do time series forecasting.
